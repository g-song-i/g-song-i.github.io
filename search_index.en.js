There are several ways to manage it such as using the kubectl CLI if you are familiar with the terminal interface, Rancher from SUSE if you prefer managing through a console, and k9s if you want a more stylish approach!\nIn this post, I will explain how to install Rancher for managing Kubernetes and discuss when it is a good choice.\nInstall Rancher with Docker\nNote that this method of installation is just for testing and demonstration purposes as described at Rancher documentation. You should choose another method if it is for production use.\nHere I have a single docker-compose file to set up and tear down the Rancher container:\n\nNow you just need to run the command (you might need \"sudo\" privileges):\n\nDive into Rancher\nLogin\nNow you can access the website via \"http\". Then you might see the login screen. Since we already defined the bootstrap password (CATTLE_BOOTSTRAP_PASSWORD) in the docker-compose file, enter \"1234\".\n \nImporting your existing cluster\nLet's import your existing cluster. To import the cluster into Rancher, you must have \"cluster-admin\" privileges. You can apply a clusterrolebinding as follows:\n\nYou can check which account you are using with the command (user in context):\n\nNow click \"Import Existing\", \n \nWrite the cluster's name, and press the create button. \n \nThen you might see some command lines to apply Rancher's YAML to create some pods for importing. I tried the first one kubectl apply -f https://~.yaml, but I encountered the message Unable to connect to the server: tls: failed to verify certificate: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority, I tried the second line curl --insecure --sfL ... | kubectl apply -f -, and it worked for me.\nYou can enter the command kubectl get pods -A just to see what pods are created for this work. \n\nAnd now you can explore your cluster and their resources on the Rancher dashboard!\n\nExplore Dashboard\nFrom here, you can see useful cluster information to inspect and debug your cluster. Rancher's dashboard offers a comprehensive overview of your cluster's health, resource usage, and more. You can utilize the dashboard to manage workloads, configure network policies, and set up service discovery.\nMore...\nLogging in Rancher\nRancher enhances the management of Kubernetes clusters by providing comprehensive logging capabilities that are crucial for monitoring the health and activities within your cluster. Here’s a brief overview of the logging features in Rancher:\n\nCentralized Logging\nIntegration with Multiple Logging Backends\nLog Analysis and Troubleshooting\n\nSetting Up Alerts\nRancher allows you to set up alerts for various events within your cluster. This feature helps in proactive monitoring and can alert administrators about critical issues before they impact your operations. Setting up alerts involves specifying the conditions and thresholds that trigger notifications.\nBy integrating these features into your daily operations, you can maintain a robust, efficient, and secure Kubernetes environment, ensuring your applications run smoothly and reliably.\nWhen Is Using Rancher a Good Choice?\nWhile tools like kubectl and k9s offer powerful ways to interact with Kubernetes, each has its context where it excels. Rancher, in particular, stands out in several scenarios:\nUser-Friendliness for Non-Terminal Users\nOne of the primary advantages of using Rancher is its user-friendly graphical interface. If you or your team are not familiar or comfortable with command-line interfaces, Rancher provides a more accessible entry point into managing Kubernetes. Its dashboard presents complex cluster information and operations in a visual format, making it easier to understand and manage without deep command-line expertise.\nComprehensive Management from a Single Pane\nRancher offers a centralized management pane for all Kubernetes clusters. This is particularly useful for organizations managing multiple clusters, possibly across different environments (cloud and on-prem). Instead of switching between different terminal windows or scripts, Rancher gives you a unified overview and control point for deploying, managing, and scaling applications across all your clusters.\nExtensive Catalog of Applications\nRancher comes with a built-in catalog of Helm charts and other applications, which can be deployed with just a few clicks. This is particularly advantageous for teams looking to rapidly deploy and test new applications without going through the CLI-based setup of Helm or other package managers.\n","id":"https://g-song-i.github.io/posts/how-to-manage-your-kubernetes-01-rancher/","title":"How to manage your kubernetes cluster 01: Rancher"},"https://g-song-i.github.io/posts/how-to-validate-docker-is-secure/":{"body":"Overview\nToday, I'll discuss how to interact with Docker on your host using the Go SDK. The 'go-docker' project by the Docker group was archived on March 11, 2024, and integrated into the Moby project. This change has modified how it is used.\nNext, I will explain how to verify if your Docker environment is properly configured for production. I will reference the CIS benchmark and discuss how to maintain a secure environment in compliance with these standards.\nGet Docker’s Configuration from a Docker Client\nCreate Docker Client\nTo retrieve Docker’s configuration from the Docker daemon, you first need to create a Docker client. Creating a new Docker client with the following code is recommended for efficiency and reusability:\n\nCreate Middleware Function\nThis process can be skipped as it merely replicates the original functionality. I created the middleware function for the SDK for convenience:\n\nRun it!\nNow, you can run the code in your desired manner. In my case, I expose this code via the go-gin web framework and Swagger API docs, allowing you to simply click the “Execute” button to retrieve the data. The result provides comprehensive information about your Docker system.\n\nCIS Benchmark\nUnderstanding CIS Benchmark\nBefore starting the evaluation of the security benchmark, let's explore what the CIS benchmark is and why it is important to adhere to it.\nCIS Benchmark\nThe CIS (Center for Internet Security) Benchmarks are consensus-based best practice standards for security configurations. They offer detailed guidelines for various platforms and systems to ensure secure configurations.\nWhy is it important?\n\nEnhanced Security: CIS Benchmarks provide technical controls to mitigate vulnerabilities and protect assets from cyber attacks.\nCompliance: Adhering to CIS Benchmarks helps meet regulatory requirements aligned with standards such as HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and SOX.\nConsistent Implementation: Following CIS Benchmarks enables organizations to implement consistent security policies and procedures, standardizing security across systems and ensuring uniform security levels.\n\nValidate if Your Docker Configuration is Secure\nEnsure live restore is enabled\nOne critical aspect of the CIS Docker Benchmark is “2.15 Ensure live restore is enabled.” Here’s a quote from the CIS Benchmark explaining its importance:\n\nThe&nbsp;--live-restore&nbsp;option enables full support of daemon-less containers within Docker. It ensures that Docker does not stop containers on shutdown or restore and that it properly reconnects to the container when restarted.\n\nThen, how can we get this one? According to the CIS Benchmark, we can check this configuration through docker command like docker info --format '{{ .LiveRestoreEnabled }}'  or simple use ps command like ps -ef | grep dockerd .\nBut we want this to be programmatic, right?\nTo do that, you can use the function we wrote above. The code looks like this:\n\nRun it!\nExecute the code using go-gin and Swagger for API documentation. You can then determine if your Docker configuration meets the CIS Benchmark standards.\n\nConclusion\nThis post demonstrated how to interact with Docker using the Go SDK, specifically focusing on secure configuration practices as outlined by the CIS benchmark. By programmatically assessing and validating Docker security settings, this approach serves as a foundational method for implementing Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM). It ensures compliance with regulatory standards such as HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and SOX, while standardizing security practices across all cloud and container environments. Such proactive security measures are crucial for maintaining integrity and security in today’s complex cloud landscapes, ensuring that environments are not only compliant but resilient against potential threats.\n","id":"https://g-song-i.github.io/posts/how-to-validate-docker-is-secure/","title":"How to Validate That Your Docker Configuration is Secure Using the Go SDK"},"https://g-song-i.github.io/posts/setting-up-kubernetes-cluster-on-aws-ec2-with-calico-cni/":{"body":"Overview\nIn this post, I am going to explain how to set up a Kubernetes cluster within the AWS infrastructure. Here, I set up a master node and two worker nodes using AWS EC2 instances. I refer to this post for this task, but I utilize Calico as the CNI plugin instead of WeaveNet, which was used in the post I mentioned. The choice of CNI plugin is up to you.\nInfra Info\n\nCreate VPC\nFirst, I created a VPC for this task. To avoid using the same CIDR range as the Calico network, I chose the “172.16.0.0/16” range. Since this cluster is not intended for active development or production, I opted to use just one availability zone and one subnet. You can add more if needed.\n\nCreate SG\nFor Master\nYou now need to create security groups for the master and worker nodes, respectively. You can see the ports that need to be opened.\n\nThe security group displayed below is the result of the initial configuration. Additional ports will need to be added later for the CNI plugin (Calico, in my case).\n\nFor Workers\nFor the next step, create the worker node's security group. This security group needs to include ports for the kubelet API, kube-proxy, and the port range for NodePort services.\n\nCreate EC2\nYou will now create EC2 instances for the cluster. You are free to choose the configurations, but you should pay particular attention to the instance type and networking settings. In my case, I selected a t2.xlarge instance for the master and t2.large instances for the workers. For network settings, choose a public subnet to enable SSH access to the instance, and apply the security group you previously configured.\n\nCreate EIP (Elastic IP)\nSince the instance does not have a public IP (though you can configure one using the auto-assign public IP function), you will need to associate an Elastic IP (EIP) with the instance. First, allocate 3 EIPs under EC2 &gt; Network &amp; Security &gt; Elastic IPs. Once allocated, you can associate each EIP with an instance. Now, you will be able to connect to your EC2 instance.\nAllocate EIP\n\nAssociate EIP\n\nInstall CRI, kubeadm, kubelet and kubectl\nOnce connected to the instances, it is time to install the Container Runtime Interface (CRI) and some packages for Kubernetes installation. Before that, you need to turn off the swap. Swap space is an extension of physical RAM and helps maintain system stability and performance by providing virtual memory [2].\nBut why is turning off swap necessary?\n\nThe debates about this are extremely interesting. So, I am going to share them.\nFirst, we essentially need to turn off swap to utilize all Kubernetes functionalities appropriately, according to this discussion:\n\n\nSupport for swap is non-trivial. Guaranteed pods should never require swap. Burstable pods should have their requests met without requiring swap. BestEffort pods have no guarantee. The kubelet right now lacks the smarts to provide the right amount of predictable behavior here across pods.\n\n\nHowever, there is an interesting official post from Kubernetes. You can now use the beta version of support for using swap on Linux! Quite interesting, right? You can read the articles I embedded:\n\n\nThis was due to the inherent difficulty in guaranteeing and accounting for pod memory utilization when swap memory was involved. As a result, swap support was deemed out of scope in the initial design of Kubernetes, and the default behavior of a kubelet was to fail to start if swap memory was detected on a node.\n\n\nSwap in Kubernetes has numerous use cases for a wide range of users. As a result, the Node Special Interest Group within the Kubernetes project has invested significant effort into supporting swap on Linux nodes for beta. Compared to the alpha, the kubelet's support for running with swap enabled is more stable and robust, more user-friendly, and addresses many known shortcomings. This graduation to beta represents a crucial step towards achieving the goal of fully supporting swap in Kubernetes.\n\nSwap off and Set the host name (optional)\n\nUpdate /etc/hosts file\nAfter naming each host, update the /etc/hosts file on each node with their IP addresses and corresponding host names. This ensures that every host in the network can recognize each other by their new host names. You may also need to configure your VPC by enabling DNS hostnames.\nThen, exit the terminal and reconnect to the instances to see that the host names have been changed.\n\nInstall containerd\nIn this step, you will install containerd as the Container Runtime Interface (CRI). I used a script from this post, which you can also refer to. I uploaded the script to the instances and executed it; it worked for me. \nThe script performs several critical setup tasks: it loads necessary kernel modules, configures system settings for network traffic management, updates the package list, installs containerd, generates a default configuration for containerd, and restarts the service to apply all changes.\n\nInstallation Script\n\nYou should also modify containerd’s configuration file as shown below (then you should restart the service):\n\n\nInstall kubeadm, kubelet and kubectl\nNow, install kubeadm, kubelet, and kubectl using the script from this post. The script updates the package list, establishes a new Kubernetes software repository, and installs the latest versions of kubeadm, kubelet, and kubectl. It also fixes these packages at their current versions to prevent automatic updates.\n\nInstallation Script\n\nInitialize Cluster\nHere, you will initialize the cluster using the kubeadm command. Before that, you need to set IPADDR, which is your current IP address, to be used as --apiserver-advertise-address, and also set POD_CIDR. Since these two are on the same network level, their subnets should not overlap. In the case of Calico, the default CIDR is 192.168.0.0/16; that’s why I chose this range for POD_CIDR and another range for the VPC.\nAfter initialization, you should copy your kubeconfig and set the privileges appropriately using the commands below. Alternatively, you can use the commands with sudo. Be sure to retain the join command, which allows worker nodes to join your cluster.\nInit Kubeadm\n\nInstall Calico as CNI plugin\nNow it is time to install a CNI (Container Network Interface) plugin. So far, you might find that the master node is in a 'not ready' status, and some pods, like core-dns, are not operational. This is because, without a network interface provided by a CNI, the pods cannot establish network connections necessary for their operations. A CNI plugin is essential for facilitating communication between pods across the cluster. It configures the network layer by assigning IP addresses to pods and managing the network routes so that pods can communicate with each other and with the external network.\nYou can download the calico.yaml file and apply it! However, make sure to remove the 'NoSchedule' taint from the master’s configuration, so that Calico pods can be scheduled on the master node.\n\nOpen ports in SG for Calico\nAdditionally, you must include a security group rule for the Calico port, which is TCP 179, for both master and worker nodes\nJoind Worker Nodes\nNow, all you need to do for the worker nodes is to execute the command sudo kubeadm join so that they can be recognized and utilized by the master node. After joining you can check their status with kubectl command in the master node.\n\n\nConclusion\nIn this post, we walked through the detailed steps of setting up a Kubernetes cluster on AWS with EC2 instances for the master and worker nodes, utilizing Calico as the CNI plugin. I hope this post helps you understand the process and the importance of each step. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to reach out to me.

What I needed was to implement code to prove that my academic theories worked. So, I had an idea of “how to code,” but it definitely differed from “how to code well.”\nNow, I am working as a research engineer in a company. This role still does not require me to code “well,” but I want to ensure my work is presentable and shareable with the development department. In this post, I will share the challenges I have encountered while coding.\nChaotic Situation\nWhile developing a proof of concept (PoC) code, I encountered a quite chaotic situation. I wrote the code in Go, with two primary components: the collector and the evaluator. The objectives are:\n- Collector: To fetch cloud configurations from a Cloud Service Provider (CSP) using an Open API.\n- Evaluator: To assess these configurations to determine their security.\nBelow is a portion of my project structure:\n\n\n\nEach directory contains a common.go, which defines common functions used by the evaluator, and types.go, which is utilized when receiving responses from the CSP. Other components mainly belong to the evaluator.\n\n\nHere is an example from security_group/common.go:\n\n\n\n\nFuntionalities of this code:\n\nIt calls SendRequest with a specified type from types.go.\nIt processes the response and returns it.\n\n\nCharacteristics of this code:\n\nIt is an internal function, as indicated by the lowercase first letter of the function name.\nIt uses config, which may not seem directly related to this function's primary operations.\n\n\nAlthough I was initially uncomfortable using config in this function, as it seemed indirectly related to the function’s core duties, the fact that four evaluators are already using this function led me to continue its use.\n\nTesting Operation: More Chaotic\nAfter this, I integrated the Go-Gin framework into the project to create RESTful APIs and expose API documentation to the development team. Given the increased complexity of the project structure, it became necessary to create test code for each function.\n\nConsequently, I added a new common.go under the firewall directory:\n\n\n\nHowever, when I tried to test it, I encountered an error because I could not initialize the config() function during local tests; it does not support this since config locates the executable path and imports config.yaml from that position. I considered rewriting config to use a relative path, but I realized that would not address the core problem.\nTo resolve this, I modified the code as follows:\n\n\n\nI also created common_test.go to include the test code:\n\n\nThis modification successfully resolved the issue.\nIsn’t it too abstract?\nOkay, now I've resolved the problem. But have I really addressed the root issue? Let me summarize the current situation:\n\nCommon functions, such as listFirewall, merely act as bridges between callers and evaluators.\nThey do not directly use config.\nThey are internal functions and can only be called from evaluators when needed.\n\nThis setup seems simple, but is it appropriately abstract or efficient? I find myself facing new complexities.\nI tried this to test performance of two functions:\n\n(I \"planned to upload testing result as images\", but I was too lazy, sorry 🤣)\n\nPerformance:\n\nWith an abstraction layer: approximately 400ms overall\nDirectly sending requests: approximately 325ms overall\n\n\nOf course, the difference isn't significant, as it's just a small abstraction layer in action. Also, I can't be entirely sure about the constant responsiveness of the CSP’s server, but I wanted to run this test anyway. It was more about satisfying my curiosity and seeing the practical impact of the abstraction, rather than expecting major discrepancies. Testing like this helps me understand the overhead introduced by additional layers in our architecture, even if minimal. It’s an essential part of optimizing and ensuring that we’re making informed decisions when it comes to the balance between code maintainability and system performance.\n\nHow to decide to abstract or not to abstract?\nHere, I summarize some points, which can be discussed when you decide whether to abstract the code or not. I read articles and papers, then discuss them with GPT. 🙂 Hope it will be fun\nReusability\nReusability is paramount in software development as it significantly reduces the time and effort required to develop and maintain code. By designing modules and components that can be reused in different parts of the application or even in different projects, developers can ensure consistency, reduce errors, and accelerate development cycles. Effective reusability promotes a DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) approach and can lead to more efficient, cleaner code.\nComplexity\nManaging complexity effectively is crucial for maintaining the readability and maintainability of the codebase. Complexity can arise from various factors, such as intricate control flow, high inter-module dependencies, or simply from trying to incorporate too many features at once. Simplifying complex systems through well-thought-out design patterns, clear documentation, and modular architecture can help in minimizing the cognitive load on developers and maintaining the system more manageable over time.\nTestability\nTestability is a measure of how easily a software system can be tested. This is crucial for ensuring long-term reliability and ease of changes. Highly testable systems are modular, have clear boundaries, and minimal dependencies, which allow for more straightforward unit testing. Investing in testability leads to software that is less prone to bugs and easier to update and expand without introducing errors.\nScalability\nScalability must be considered to accommodate growth in user demand, data volume, and computational intensity without compromising performance. Designing systems that can scale effectively involves considerations of load balancing, resource management, and the ability to upgrade or expand components without significant disruptions. Scalability ensures that the software continues to perform optimally as it grows and adapts to increased operational demands.\nResults?\nFinally, I decided to abstract my code for the following reasons:\n\nMy code is primarily for a Proof of Concept (PoC), so it does not currently need to scale significantly. The current level of abstraction should suffice.\nHowever, since the development team will review my code, clarity is crucial. Clear, well-abstracted code facilitates easier understanding and maintenance.\nSome interface code, such as authentication, making requests, and common functions, may be reused by the development team. This reusability underscores the need for clarity.\nThe code must be easy to test whenever new functions are introduced, ensuring reliability and ease of maintenance.\n\nThrough this exploration, I found the process of optimizing and abstracting code to be quite engaging. It provided a valuable opportunity to reconsider best practices in coding within the context of a real-world application.\n","id":"https://g-song-i.github.io/posts/trade-off-between-code-abstraction-and-performance/","title":"Trade-off between Code Abstraction and Performance"},"https://g-song-i.github.io/posts/w-where-tf-is-docker-daemon-json-file/":{"body":"Overview\nThis article looks into the details of Docker daemon configurations after I noticed that the daemon.json file was missing from my host system. It explains what the Docker daemon is, what it does, and why the daemon.json file is missing. The discussion includes how Docker is typically set up and how to access and understand the daemon's settings. \nBackgrounds\nWhat is Docker Daemon?\nLet's grab some background first. What do you think the Docker daemon is?\nThe Docker daemon is a part of the Docker engine, running on the host OS as a process. According to Aqua Security, the Docker daemon is described as follows:\n\nA persistent background process that manages Docker images, containers, networks, and storage volumes. The Docker daemon constantly listens for Docker API requests and processes them.\n\nWhat is Docker’s daemon.json?\nThe daemon.json file is used for configuring the Docker daemon. According to the official Docker documentation, there are two ways to configure the Docker daemon:\n\n\nUse a JSON configuration file. This is the preferred option, since it keeps all configurations in a single place.\nUse flags when starting&nbsp;dockerd.\n\n\nYou can use both ways for configuring the daemon. According to this post, setting it with a JSON file is preferred, but I'm not sure (it's not from the official documentation). \nHow to get Docker daemon configuration?\nNow you know that the Docker daemon is a process responsible for managing Docker's components, and there is a file named daemon.json that contains configurations for the Docker daemon. So, how do you get the Docker daemon's configuration when Docker is running? There are two options:\n\nGet the configuration from the daemon.json file if the daemon is started with it\nGet the configuration using the docker info command\n\nYou can use the ps command to inspect the dockerd process, but it might not display all the configurations we need. Additionally, you can check the configuration file, daemon.json, but there is no direct way to confirm whether the current Docker daemon was started using that specific file.\nBut, we can assume that if the ps command returns a path to a file with the --config-file parameter, then dockerd was started with that file. If not, dockerd was started with the default configuration, either from their default location or the configuration embedded in the software upon installation. You can refer here to see the code for default configuration.\nDaemon file’s default location\nAccording to this post from the Docker docs, the Docker daemon expects to find the configuration file by default at this location:\nOSFile\nLinux, regular setup/etc/docker/daemon.json\nLinux, rootless mode~/.config/docker/daemon.json\nWindowsC:\\ProgramData\\docker\\config\\daemon.json\n\nW(Where)TF is my daemon.json????\nThis part is the most important in this post. I couldn’t find my daemon.json in the default location. What’s happening? Like what I said, Dockerd can be started with the default configuration without a configuration file, as it is not created automatically. That’s the reason you can’t find it in your location.\nYou can create the file if you want to boot Dockerd with that in the default location, or you can use another location and specify the customized location manually. So, do not panic if there is no daemon.json; you can still get the daemon’s configuration in other ways\nGet the current Dockerd configuration\nHere, I describe ways to get the Dockerd configuration. As I mentioned before, you can find it in the daemon.json file or use the docker info command. Let’s assume that you have not created a daemon.json file before. Then, there are two options:\n\nGet the configuration using the docker info command.\nGet the configuration with the code.\n\nHah? Another option pops up, right? Let’s start!\nGet the configuration with docker info\nFirst, you can see your daemon's configuration using the docker info command. Here is what the result looks like:\n\nGet the configuration with the code (Go SDK)\nMoreover, you can write code to retrieve the configuration! I use the Go SDK for this purpose. Here is an example, and you will need to configure the way to handle the result appropriately.\n\nThe result contains a lot of data, as described here. It might differ from the result of the command in some ways, so you need to make an effort to identify the differences and choose the right option for you. Part of the result looks like this:\n\nConclusion\nTo wrap up, I found out why the daemon.json file was missing from my host system. It was because the Docker daemon was started with the default configuration. I also learned how to get the Docker daemon's configuration using the docker info command and the Go SDK. I hope this post helps you understand the Docker daemon and its configuration better.

Although I'm not certain this is the correct way to access Google Workspace, my initial goal was to utilize a single service account with privileges to manage accounts as an administrator of an organization.\nBefore proceeding, ensure:\n\nThe project that includes the service account has the Google Admin SDK API activated.\nThe service account you intend to use to connect to Google Workspace is enabled with Domain-wide delegation.\n\nProblem Statement\nWhile developing a prototype for Cloud Identity and Entitlements Management (CIEM) solutions for Google Cloud, I faced an issue listing workspace users with the Google Admin SDK API using a Google Cloud service account.\nHere's my initial code:\n\nThis configuration might be confusing:\n\nAccording to the Google Workspace’s documentation it refers to:\n\nThe unique ID for the customer's Google Workspace account. In case of a multi-domain account, to fetch all users for a customer, use this field instead of&nbsp;domain.

Here is the error I encountered:\n\n\nInitially, I was confused because:\n\nI was using a Service Account’s key file, which I thought did not utilize Application Default Credentials (ADC).\nThe project number listed in the error message’s “consumer” section wasn’t even part of my organization.\nI had already activated the Admin SDK API for my project.\n\n\n\nMethod 1: Setting the Quota Project\nI attempted to configure a quota project when sending the request since the error message indicated, \"The admin.googleapis.com API requires a quota project, which is not set by default.\" Here's the revised code:\n\nAnd…. no way! it was failed 😕&nbsp;the error message here:\n\nMethod 2: Impersonating as a Workspace User with a Service Account\nAfter trying various authentication methods, I discovered a helpful post suggesting that to use the Admin SDK API effectively, the service account must impersonate an administrator of the domain; simply enabling domain-wide delegation was insufficient.\nOkay, we will try. But note that, you should ensure,\n\nThe workspace user you attempt to impersonate is aware of this process.\nYour Service Account has the \"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.user.readonly\" permission set in the Workspace Admin Console, indicating that the workspace administrator is aware of your activities.\n\nTo implement this, configure your service account as follows:\n\nIn my code, config library works getting global configuration for the code. So it gets admin email, which you impersonate. Otherwise, cred and privateKey are from the Service Account’s key fie. Other process are same to before. \nAnd… IT FINALLY SUCCEEDED! 😂\nREVIEW\nI believe this method succeeded because it authenticated correctly with the necessary permissions and within the proper administrative context. Although the service account was granted permissions through its client ID, Google Workspace is designed for organizations and their human employees, necessitating this specific authentication procedure. Despite the challenges, I found the experience both stressful and enjoyable!\nREF\n\nhttps://www.googlecloudcommunity.com/gc/Cloud-Hub/Admin-SDK-API-Returning-Status-Code-403-Cannot-Figure-Out-Root/m-p/742710#M6830\nhttps://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/reference/rest/v1/users/list#query-parameters\n\n","id":"https://g-song-i.github.io/posts/way-to-access-to-google-workspace-with-service-account/","title":"The Way to Access to Google Workspace with Google Cloud’s Service Account"}},"docInfo":{"https://g-song-i.github.io/":{"body":139,"title":4},"https://g-song-i.github.io/posts/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://g-song-i.github.io/posts/how-to-manage-your-kubernetes-01-rancher/":{"body":461,"title":5},"https://g-song-i.github.io/posts/how-to-validate-docker-is-secure/":{"body":357,"title":7},"https://g-song-i.github.io/posts/setting-up-kubernetes-cluster-on-aws-ec2-with-calico-cni/":{"body":746,"title":8},"https://g-song-i.github.io/posts/trade-off-between-code-abstraction-and-performance/":{"body":632,"title":5},"https://g-song-i.github.io/posts/w-where-tf-is-docker-daemon-json-file/":{"body":410,"title":4},"https://g-song-i.github.io/posts/way-to-access-to-google-workspace-with-service-account/":{"body":344,"title":8}},"length":8},"lang":"English"};
