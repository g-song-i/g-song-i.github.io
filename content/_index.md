During my journey in this company, I research how to setup cloud infrastructure with CSPs such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google GCP and cloud-native infrastructure with CSPs (managed K8s) such as AKS, GKE, EKS and on-premise kubernetes. Then research actual compliances no matter global or domestic. I finally develop prototype of CSPM to prove my research works. You can find my tech stack (and background, too) to achieve it.
