During my academic journey in graduate school, I was engaged in a project focused on ensuring 5G MEC (Multi-access Edge Computing) security, utilizing containers and virtual machines (VMs) on the edge. To achieve this, I identified the necessary protection methods required throughout the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), with particular emphasis on runtime security for containers.

During runtime, a program operates as an active process rather than merely existing as a binary file. Therefore, it needs robust, privileged, yet safe protection mechanisms. One such tool is eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter), which provides the capability to enforce security policies effectively.

I implemented several security solutions using eBPF to enforce these security policies, thereby monitoring and protecting the entire cloud-native infrastructure. Here, you can see how to enhance security during a typical SDLC, along with my patents and papers that detail the implementation of these improvements.

During my tenure at this company, I have conducted extensive research on setting up cloud infrastructure with various Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Additionally, I explored cloud-native infrastructure using managed Kubernetes services provided by these CSPs, including Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), as well as on-premises Kubernetes solutions.

I also delved into compliance requirements, both global and domestic such as CIS, PCI-DSS, ISMS-P and so on. Ultimately, I developed a prototype of a Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) tool to demonstrate the practical applications of my research.

My technical stack and background, which were essential in my research for CSPM, include but are not limited to:

Beyond this, I've researched other components of Cloud-Native Application Protection Platforms (CNAPP) to support a broad range of protection for cloud assets, including Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM), Cloud Workload Protection Platforms (CWPP), and Application Security Posture Management (ASPM).
